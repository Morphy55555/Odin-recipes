    <H2 class="align"><em>Description</em></H2>
    <p><em><strong> Green Curry is a flavorful and aromatic dish that combines the bold spices and herbs typical of Thai cuisine.</strong></em> </p> 
    
    <p> Curry is made with a fragrant green curry paste, which is traditionally prepared by blending fresh ingredients such as green chilies, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, and Thai basil. These ingredients give the curry its signature bright, slightly spicy, and herbal flavor. </p>

    <p>Curry is typically cooked with coconut milk, creating a rich and creamy sauce that complements the heat of the curry paste. Vegetables, tofu, or meat (such as chicken, beef, or shrimp) are often added, along with bamboo shoots, bell peppers, and Thai eggplants. The dish is typically served with jasmine rice to balance out the spiciness. Garnished with fresh cilantro or Thai basil, Thai Green Curry is a perfect blend of sweet, salty, sour, and spicy flavors that make it a beloved dish both in Thailand and worldwide.</p>
